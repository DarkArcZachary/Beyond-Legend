{"name":"Beyond-legend","tagline":"DarkArc Games","body":"### Welcome to DarkArc Games!.\r\nThis is our main site for are development, it uses GitHub. Updates, Announcements, and early access game builds exclusive to our community!\r\n### Who are we?\r\nDarkArc Games is a small group with 11 developers. We are located on the west coast and create open world games that are dynamic and are for the players, not the money.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Why are the players more important?\r\nIn the game industry today, there is so many games that are over-hyped because the developers advertised a false statement and it caused the players to pre-order the game to install it and be hit with anger and a \"I want my money back!\" attitude. For DarkArc, the players mean more then money I would rather have a community of 1000 people then 100,000 dollars. Because money runs out, support, kindness, and motivation don't.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nZachary- Lead Programmer\r\n\r\nMichael- Lead Graphical and Gameplay programmer\r\n\r\nMccay- Lead UI and AI Programmer\r\n\r\nGabe- Artist\r\n\r\nJoe- Programmer\r\n\r\nPayte- Animation\r\n\r\nJack- Artist\r\n\r\nNick- Landscape and world design\r\n\r\nMicha- Props and Character Designer\r\n\r\nNoah- Artist\r\n\r\nMichael- Writer\r\n\r\nZachary- Writer of main protagonists enemy\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\ndarkarczachary@gmail.com\r\n\r\ndarkarcinfo@gmail.com\r\n\r\nInstagram- DarkArcGames\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
